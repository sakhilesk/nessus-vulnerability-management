<h1>Nessus Vulnerability management</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<b>I conducted a Nessus vulnerability scan on a Windows 10 virtual machine to identify potential security weaknesses and threats. The project involved configuring Nessus to scan the VM, analyzing the scan results to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity levels, and implementing remediation measures to mitigate the identified risks. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and learned effective strategies for securing Windows 10 systems against cyber threats.
