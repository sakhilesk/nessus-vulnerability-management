<h1>Nessus Vulnerability management</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<b>I conducted a Nessus vulnerability scan on a Windows 10 virtual machine to identify potential security weaknesses and threats. The project involved configuring Nessus to scan the VM, analyzing the scan results to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity levels, and implementing remediation measures to mitigate the identified risks. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and learned effective strategies for securing Windows 10 systems against cyber threats.

I first created a Nessus account

<h3>Downloaded an old Firefox version then did a scan</h3>
<h2>Results</h2>

<h2>Uninstalled the Old firefox version and did some few windows updates which came out with less vulnerabilities</h2>
<h3>Results</h3>
